	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<h3>What is Netero?</h3>
	<p>There are millions of immigrants in the US that regularly send money to their families in other countries. These funds are mostly used for every day expenses such as groceries, paying bills, and buying medicine. Netero offers a <span>FREE service</span> that allows your family to pay for all of these things without the need to use cash! </p>

	<h3>How long does it take for the prepaid credit I send to be avaialable at my selected retailer?</h3>
	<p>A transaction is usually completed and available within <span>5 minutes</span> of payment. There are instances where the amount of time for a transaction to be validated may take longer due to identity verification or technical reasons, but our aim is always to provide fast access for your recipients to the prepaid credit that you purchase. If there is a problem with your transaction, we will contact you directly to solve any issues. Transactions that can't be processed are usually canceled automatically within one hour. In case your payment method was billed, Netero processes a full refund immediately. </p>

	<h3>Which countries are currently supported by Netero?</h3>
	<p>Currently, you can only buy prepaid credit from partners based in <span>Mexico</span>. This means that you can only use the service in the US, and can only purchase prepaid credit from partners that are located in Mexico. We will continue adding new partners and countries in a regular basis. Please check back regularly for updates.</p>
